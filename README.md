# Chest X-Ray Image Analysis

## Overview

This Streamlit app analyzes chest X-ray images to detect potential abnormalities using a pre-trained DenseNet121 model. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and processing images, and it visualizes predictions with Grad-CAM.

Check out the live Streamlit App [here]([https://x-rayghh.streamlit.app/]).

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Accepts chest X-ray images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- **Abnormality Detection**: Uses a machine learning model to predict the probability of 14 different conditions.
- **Grad-CAM Visualization**: Highlights areas of the image most relevant to the model's predictions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy and intuitive use.

## Important Notes

- This tool is for educational purposes only.
- It is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
- Ensure you upload only chest X-ray images for accurate results.

## Instructions

1. **Upload a Chest X-Ray Image**: Click on the "Upload a chest X-ray image" button and select an image file.
2. **View the Results**: The app will display the uploaded image, prediction results, and Grad-CAM visualizations.
3. **Explore Further**: Visit the portfolio and source code repository for more projects and insights.
